# What is RFCs

https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/

RFC documents contain technical specifications and organizational notes for the Internet.

RFCs means `Request For Comment`, but today is only known as `RFC`. The first document in this series, RFC 1, was written in 1969. It was soon followed by others, including those that describe the core Internet Protocol (IP) still used in the Internet today.
